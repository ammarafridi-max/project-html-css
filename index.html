                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>In 2008, Pria, the current owner of Hair Day, earned her certificate as a colorist and immediately started specializing in edgy, custom coloring techniques. She wanted to create a "treat yourself" environment for her clients. That's when she and her friend, Garry, came up with the idea of Hair Day.
